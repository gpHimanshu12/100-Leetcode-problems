# 🧠 100 Days of LeetCode

This repository contains my solutions to **100 essential LeetCode problems**, covering **Data Structures and Algorithms** commonly asked in **FAANG / top product-based company interviews**.

The goal of this repo is to:
- Build **strong DSA fundamentals**
- Practice **patterns**, not just problems
- Improve **problem-solving + coding speed**
- Become **interview-ready**

## 📂 Topic-wise Problem Categories

This repository is organized by DSA topics to help understand **patterns** instead of random problem solving.

| Folder Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Array** | Problems based on traversal, prefix sums, sorting, searching, etc. |
| **String** | Pattern matching, frequency maps, transformations, substring logic. |
| **LinkedList** | Node operations, reversing, merging, cycle detection, etc. |
| **Stack** | Parenthesis problems, monotonic stack, evaluators, backtracking helper. |
| **Queue** | FIFO operations, circular queues, and queue-based patterns. |
| **Hashing** | Problems using hash maps/sets for fast lookup and frequency counts. |
| **TwoPointers** | Problems involving two indices narrowing or expanding across arrays/strings. |
| **BinarySearch** | Classic binary search + binary search on answer problems. |
| **SlidingWindow** | Subarray/substring problems optimizing using dynamic windows. |
| **Trees** | Binary trees, traversal techniques, recursive DFS, BFS. |
| **Graphs** | Graph traversal (BFS, DFS), shortest paths, connectivity problems. |
| **DynamicProgramming** | Optimization problems using memoization/tabulation. |


Each problem goes inside the correct topic folder.

File name format:
